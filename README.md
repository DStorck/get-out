# Get Out !
And do something fun.  Maybe this will help.

##What it is.
This app will let you keep track of things you like, and help you find events in your city.
Folks will be able to log in and search for concerts, sports events, festivals, or whatever other thing they are into.  The app will keep track of all the 'things' a user has said they like, and each time they log in they can choose to just use specific search words, or go buck wild and search everything.  

###Keep track of stuff.
Once a search has been performed, each element will show up with a checkbox that a user can click on.  This will save it to their potential calendar of funtimes.  It can be deleted off at any point, and will automatically self-destruct once the event has passed.
